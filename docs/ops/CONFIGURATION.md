# Configuration reference

The one place that lists every config field. Each file is JSON in the role's
work directory (`-d <dir>`). Omitted optional fields take the defaults below;
anything not listed here is fixed in code.

| File | Role | Read when |
|------|------|-----------|
| `init-config.json` | beacon | `pp-beacon --init --genesis-key …` only (genesis); a missing file is written as a template |
| `config.json` | beacon, relay, miner | every start (created with defaults if missing) |
| `keys/amp-identity.txt` | beacon, relay | every start; created on first start |

## `init-config.json` (beacon, genesis)

```json
{
  "networkId": "my-network",
  "systemAccounts": {
    "genesis": {"publicKeys": ["<hex>", "<hex>", "<hex>"], "minSignatures": 2},
    "fee":     {"publicKeys": ["<hex>"]},
    "reserve": {"publicKeys": ["<hex>"]},
    "recycle": {"publicKeys": ["<hex>"]}
  },
  "genesisMiners": [
    {"id": 1048576, "publicKeys": ["<hex ML-DSA-65 public key>"]}
  ]
}
```

```bash
pp-beacon -d beacon --init --genesis-key genesis1.key --genesis-key genesis2.key
```

**Keys: each holder makes its own** (`pp-client keygen -o <name>` writes
`<name>.key` and `<name>.pub`). The config holds public keys only; the beacon
never generates or stores an account's private key. `--genesis-key` (repeat
for M-of-N) signs the genesis block; the keys must be distinct genesis keys and
at least its `minSignatures`.

**The genesis account is the admin key.** It signs config updates (`T_CONFIG`)
and issues to reserve after genesis, so it must be M-of-N from the start: at
least 3 keys and 2 signatures (the shape its renewals and updates are held to).
Keep its keys offline with different people; the beacon needs them only for
`--init`. A config update can replace the genesis keys (rotation).

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `networkId` | **required** | This chain's name. Part of genesis: every signature and the epoch seed bind to it; offline signing (`pp-client sign-tx --network-id`) must name it |
| `systemAccounts` | **required** | `genesis`, `fee`, `reserve`, `recycle`: each `{publicKeys, minSignatures?}` (default: all keys must sign). Genesis: ≥ 3 keys, ≥ 2 signatures |
| `slotDuration` | 7 | Seconds per slot |
| `slotsPerEpoch` | 86400 | Slots per epoch |
| `heartbeatSlots` | `slotsPerEpoch` | Empty block when the tip lags this many slots (0 = off) |
| `maxTransactionsPerBlock` | 10240 | |
| `maxCustomMetaSize` / `freeCustomMetaSize` | 1 MiB / 1024 | Account meta bytes allowed / free of fee |
| `minFeeCoefficients` | `[1, 1, 1]` | Fee = a + b·x + c·x², x = non-free meta KiB (rounded up) |
| `checkpointMinBlocks` / `checkpointMinAgeSeconds` | 2²⁰ / 1 year | Renewal cut-off (accounts last written before it must renew) |
| `maxValidationTimespanSeconds` | 86400 | Widest allowed transaction validity window |
| `genesisMiners` | none | Miner accounts created at genesis (below) |

**Genesis miners.** System accounts (genesis, fee, reserve, recycle) never
lead slots, so a new chain needs miners from block 0. Each entry creates one:

- `id` — in the issued range `[1048576, 1073741824)` (2²⁰ ≤ id < 2³⁰)
- `publicKeys` — hex ML-DSA-65 public keys; the miner keeps the private keys
  (`pp-client keygen`)
- `minSignatures` — optional, default: all keys
- `stake` — optional initial balance taken from reserve; default an equal share
  of 10% of the supply among miners without an explicit stake

## Beacon `config.json`

```json
{ "port": 8517 }
```

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `port` | 8517 | UDP listen port |

## Relay `config.json`

```json
{ "beacon": "/ip4/10.0.0.1/udp/8517/adp/1.0.0/p2p/<beacon peer id>" }
```

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `beacon` | **required** | Upstream multiaddr (the beacon or another relay), ending in `/p2p/<peer id>` |
| `port` | 8519 | UDP listen port |

## Miner `config.json`

```json
{
  "minerId": 1048576,
  "keys": ["key.txt"],
  "beacons": ["/ip4/10.0.0.2/udp/8519/adp/1.0.0/p2p/<relay peer id>"]
}
```

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `minerId` | **required** | The miner's account id (e.g. a genesis miner) |
| `keys` | **required** | Files with the account's hex private keys; the first is also the miner's network identity |
| `beacons` | **required** | Upstream multiaddrs (relays, or the beacon), each ending in `/p2p/<peer id>` |
| `port` | 8518 | UDP listen port (miners only dial out; nothing needs to reach it) |
| `networkAnchor` | none | Optional pins checked against upstreams: `{"networkId", "genesisHash", "trustedCheckpointId"}` |

## Identity keys

The beacon and each relay create `keys/amp-identity.txt` on first start; its
peer id is the `/p2p/` part of their multiaddr, printed at start as
`AMP ledger listener: ...`. A miner's identity is its first account key.

## Network timing (fixed)

Not configurable. Every request deadline derives from one RPC timeout T = 15 s
(`NetworkTuning`), so they cannot drift apart:

| Deadline | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Light requests (status, calibration, register, miner list) | T |
| Data requests (blocks, transactions, accounts) | 2T |
| Server drops a request still queued after | T/2 |
| RPC channel with nothing inbound is reset after | 2T on the server, the call's deadline on the client |
| Upstream holds a `BLOCK_WAIT` for | T/2 |
| Relay / miner startup sync | 5 min |

The request queue holds 1024 requests (reads get a further quarter in a
low-priority lane, at most 16 per peer).
